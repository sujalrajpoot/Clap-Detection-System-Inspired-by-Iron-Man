# 👏 Clap Detection System – Inspired by Iron Man

A real-time **clap detection system** built in **Python** using **PyTorch**, inspired by the *J.A.R.V.I.S.-style* interaction from Iron Man.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect whether an audio segment contains a clap sound or not, enabling futuristic hands-free commands.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Clap Detection** – Responds instantly to claps from a microphone.
- **Deep Learning Powered** – CNN model trained with PyTorch.
- **Custom Dataset Support** – Train with your own clap samples for higher accuracy.
- **Noise Robustness** – Handles various background noises for reliable detection.
- **Iron Man Inspired** – Gives J.A.R.V.I.S.-like feel for triggering commands.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Audio Preprocessing** – Converts audio clips to **Mel Spectrograms**.
2. **Model Training** – CNN learns to differentiate clap vs non-clap patterns.
3. **Real-time Inference** – Listens via microphone and classifies incoming sounds.
4. **Trigger Actions** – Executes a command when a clap is detected (e.g., turn on lights, run a script).

## 🛠 Requirements

* **Python 3.8+**
* **PyTorch**
* **Sounddevice**
* **NumPy**

---

## 📊 Model Architecture

A **3-layer CNN** with:

* **Conv2D + ReLU + MaxPooling**
* **Batch Normalization**
* **Dropout** for regularization
* Fully connected layers for classification

---

## 📜 Instructions

### 1️⃣ Record Training Data

Run the following to record **claps** and **background noise** for training:

```bash
python record.py
```

This will save the audio files inside the `data/` folder.

---

### 2️⃣ Train the Neural Network

After recording, train the CNN model:

```bash
python trainer.py
```

The trained model will save the trained model as `audio_classifier.pth`.

---

### 3️⃣ Run Real-time Clap Detection

To start detecting claps in real-time:

```bash
python ClapDetector.py
```

If a clap is detected, it will print:

```
👏 97%
```

Otherwise, it will print:

```
No Clap Detected
```

## 🎨 Iron Man Vibes

You can customize the detection trigger to:

* Play **J.A.R.V.I.S. voice lines**
* Trigger **smart home actions**
* Run **custom Python scripts**

---

## 📈 Example Results

* **Training Accuracy:** \~97% on custom dataset
* **Real-time detection latency:** < 300ms

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Multi-clap pattern recognition.
* Integration with **Home Assistant** for IoT control.
* Mobile app version with TensorFlow Lite.

### If you want, I can also **add a J.A.R.V.I.S.-style ASCII art** to the top of the README so it looks more cinematic. That would really sell the Iron Man vibe.
