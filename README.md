# 👏 Clap Detection System – Inspired by Iron Man

A real-time **clap detection system** built in **Python** using **PyTorch**, inspired by the *J.A.R.V.I.S.-style* interaction from Iron Man.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect whether an audio segment contains a clap sound or not, enabling futuristic hands-free commands.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Clap Detection** – Responds instantly to claps from a microphone.
- **Deep Learning Powered** – CNN model trained with PyTorch.
- **Custom Dataset Support** – Train with your own clap samples for higher accuracy.
- **Noise Robustness** – Handles various background noises for reliable detection.
- **Iron Man Inspired** – Gives J.A.R.V.I.S.-like feel for triggering commands.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Audio Preprocessing** – Converts audio clips to **Mel Spectrograms**.
2. **Model Training** – CNN learns to differentiate clap vs non-clap patterns.
3. **Real-time Inference** – Listens via microphone and classifies incoming sounds.
4. **Trigger Actions** – Executes a command when a clap is detected (e.g., turn on lights, run a script).

If you want, I can also **add a J.A.R.V.I.S.-style ASCII art** to the top of the README so it looks more cinematic. That would really sell the Iron Man vibe.
